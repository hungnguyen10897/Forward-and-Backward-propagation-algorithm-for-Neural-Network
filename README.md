**Implementation of Forward and Backward propagation algorithms to train Neural network in Matlab**

This is part of the exercise 4 of the course: [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng

Part of the code was provided by the course. The actual implementation is in the files: *nnCostFunction.m* and *sigmoidGradient.m*
